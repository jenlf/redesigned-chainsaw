                    <p>I have always dreamt of one day becoming a software developer and when I started out working as an IT Helpdesk Technician in 2007 I knew I would have an 
                        amazing journey ahead. I am a tenacious learner and I enjoy the adventure of building new skills. I have loved every moment of learning systems 
                        administration, networking and security while working in my career and I have been fortunate to learn from many amazing people along the way.  
                        In 2021 I had an opportunity to return to school to study Software Engineering Technology at Conestoga College and it was a dream come true! Today I 
                        am finishing up my program and on my way to achieving my goal of becoming full-stack developer. </p>
