                    <h2>Retrospective #1 - Finishing the SET program.</h2> <br>
                    <p>Posted May 2024</p> <br>
                    <p>Deciding to take a break from my decade-long career in IT was scary but looking back now at the end of school I can say that it was one of the best decisions I ever made. 
                        I feel so fortunate to have had a chance to achieve my dream of becoming a software developer and I wanted to take some time to discuss some of the highlights of the Software 
                        Engineering Technology program and my favourite classes and projects. </p> <br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle">Year 1:</p>
                        <p>I started my programming journey in the first year with C and C++. C will always hold a very special place in my heart – I love the structure and challenges of working with a 
                            procedural language and the pure satisfaction that comes when concepts like pointers, string manipulation and garbage collection all click. </p> <br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle2">Data Structures </p>
                        <img src="../images/DS.jpg" class="retro-img">
                        <p>In Data Structures we took a journey through arrays, vectors, hash tables, queues and more. I will never forget the pride I felt when creating a doubly linked list and a hash table 
                            in C for the first time. </p> <br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle2">Computer Architecture and Machine Language. </p>
                        <img src="../images/CAML.png" class="retro-img-sm">
                        <p>In CAML We covered the fundamentals of low-level languages and computing including working in Assembly. This gave me a deeper knowledge of important fundamental concepts that are 
                            abstracted away in higher level languages. <br> <br>
                            Technologies & Languages – C/C++, x86 Assembly, Git & GitHub, Visual Studio</p> <br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle">Year 2:</p>
                        <p>The second year was a wild ride and we covered a lot of ground. The first half focused on web development, math, relational databases, embedded systems and Windows programming.</p> <br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle2">TMS Project – Full Stack application</p>
                        <img src="../images/TMS.png" class="retro-img">
                        <p>The Transport Management System was an application for freight and logistics management. I worked with a great team (shout out LowLevelLegion!) to create a full stack application 
                            from the ground up. <br> <br>
                            Technologies & Languages -  C#, WPF, MySQL, Git & GitHub, Azure Boards, TCP/IP</p><br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle2">Microprocessors & Embedded Systems – ARM Assembly projects on STM32 board</p>
                        <img src="../images/stm.gif" class="retro-img">
                        <p>I did a series of labs and projects working on the STM32 board where I worked directly with the hardware including a game that used to accelerometer to turn on LED lights as the 
                            board was tilted until the correct light is lit. <br><br>
                            Technologies & Languages – ARM Assembly, C, GNU ARM Assembly, GDB, Git & GitHub</p><br>
                        <p>The second half of the year we took on network application programming, Android mobile development, Linux system programming and advanced security. </p><br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle2">System Programming Chat Project – Linux system programming in C</p>
                        <img src="../images/chat.png" class="retro-img">
                        <p>A chat client and multi-threaded server both written in ANSI C. This project used ncurses for the User Interface and leveraged shared memory, semaphores, queues and sockets. 
                            It was a challenging project and I really enjoyed bringing this all together. <br><br>
                            Technologies & Languages – C, Ubuntu, TCP/IP, Git & GitHub</p><br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle">Year 3:</p>
                        <p>The jump into third year was pretty incredible. I spent a good amount of my second year feeling a fair amount of imposter syndrome but by the time I got to second semester of the 
                            last year I had overcome those feelings completely. The program focused a lot more on advanced topics and collaboration and I learned so much from my peers and teammates. 
                            A couple of notable mentions when it comes to classes that I loved are Graphics, Animation and Sound where we did some fun projects working with P5.js, Mobile Application Development 
                            II where I got to work with iOS & Swift and IoT class where we used AWS IoT to program an actual smart device. We covered a lot of deeply interesting material and I enjoyed every 
                            second of my classes!</p><br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle2">Advanced SQL Kanban Project </p>
                        <p>This was a very fun project where we created a simulation of a manufacturing factory floor. We had to simulate the real-time creation of parts by different workstations and then build 
                            a separate system to display the production and yield of the workstations in the form of a kanban and andon displays. This project focused primarily on TransactSQL and MSSQL Transactions
                            , Triggers, Indexing, Stored Procedures, Views, Custom Functions, Data Visualizations, performance & optimization and so much more. This project was incredible and really deepened my 
                            SQL and database skills.<br><br>
                            Technologies & Languages – C#, WPF, WinForms, MSSQL Server, SQL Server Management Studio, Visual Studio, MS Charts, TCP/IP, Tasks, Git & GitHub</p><br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle2">Capstone – Servis-Center</p>
                        <img src="../images/dash2.PNG" class="retro-img">
                        <p>This is the final project for SET that is the culmination of all the skills and technologies you learn in the program. I found this project to be one of the best parts of school 
                            and I would highly recommend doing the 3-year SET program just to do the capstone. I won’t get too detailed right now on what my team created as there will be many more Retrospectives 
                            that dive into the technology and what I learned along the way, but I can give the general overview of what capstone is about. <br>
                            Capstone starts immediately in January where I needed to join a team and have a few product ideas ready to go. I was so fortunate to team up with some really incredible developers and it 
                            set the stage for the best experience. I owe a huge thanks to Will, Addison and Taylor – working with this team was amazing and I learned so much from each of them. We are also looking 
                            forward to continuing work on this product together over the next few months!<br>
                            Once you have your idea approved you create a Software Requirement Specification document, a product pitch and get to work! We had roughly 13 weeks to start coding and get the 
                            project ready for Demo Day at the end of the semester where we presented our product to the masses in a tradeshow style event at Communitech in Kitchener, ON, Canada. I am proud to 
                            say we crushed it, and I am so proud of my entire class – every single project that was presented was amazing and I am humbled to have had a chance to learn with so many incredible 
                            people. <br><br>
                            Technologies & Languages – Node, Express, JavaScript, Next.JS, PostgreSQL, DataGrip, Flask, Docker, Git & GitHub, GitHub Actions, + more. </p><br>
                        <p class="retro-subtitle">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>The SET program is challenging and a lot of hard work but well worth the effort! The professors are industry experts and unbelievable mentors, the material is relevant, and it 
                            will give you a foundation that will set you apart as a developer. I loved all three years, and I can’t wait to see where I can go from here! <br><br>
                        
                            P.S.
                            I would 10 out of 10 recommend SET to any future potential students looking for a software development program. </p>
